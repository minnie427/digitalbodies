   Acknowledgement
</h2>

<h6>
    We pay our respects to First Peopleâ€™s Elders, past and present, and we respectfully acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures as the oldest continuous cultures in the world.

    We acknowledge that we are sitting on unceded lands belonging to the traditional custodians, the Wurundjeri and Boon Wurrung people of the Kulin Nation.
    
    This is Indigenous land and always will be.

    Welcome to our project
</h2>


<h3>
    This project is a curation of interactive 3D art pieces exploring the theme of human bodies extending into the digital environment. Our works are designed utilising TouchDesigner as the main software. The curation will feature each of our works separately, along with a collaborative piece on the main screen, accompanied by music designed specifically for this project.
